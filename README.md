# INFOSCREEN APPLICATION FOR MEETING ROOM DOORWAYS

## Description
Job application assignment where i was asked to make an application based on a mock image.
The application is fully front-end and can only read json-data.
When initiated the app will read the json-data file and present a daily schedule on the screen.
The view consist of a side panel filled with a list of buttons witch open a secondary side panel presenting that event information.
The center of the window always shows the current event, a progression bar and the next upcoming reservations.

### Requirements
The app must be able to read json-data, the app must work in mobile, the app can have backend but is not required.

### What could be done

##### Testing
The app need tests to ensure all the setTimeouts work as intended and not to mention what would happen if the app would be fed with bad data.

##### Data validation
Currently there is no validation for bad data such as times that cross each other or what if a reservation doesn't have a subject.

##### Back-end
If the app would ever use a database it could use a back-end to handle the data.

##### Admin view
Control panel or admin view for editing, supervision and statistics.

##### Deployment
Heroku and a database would be nice.








This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
